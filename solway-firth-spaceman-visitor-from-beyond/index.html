Spinning a yarn</h4><p name=d40e id=d40e class=graf--p>Jim Templeton was already well known in Cumbria before his photo became a national sensation. A keen historian and amateur photographer, Jim&#x2019;s archive of local photos was a well-used resource by the areas newspapers.</p><p name=ca94 id=ca94 class=graf--p>Just weeks before the appearance of the &#x2018;spaceman&#x2019;, Jim had tricked friends with a fake five-pound note he had made using his photographic skills.</p><p name=881e id=881e class=graf--p>Did Jim fake the spaceman picture for a joke? In 1997, photo-analyst Roger Green of Bradford University studied the image and concluded that it was &#x201C;a composite made using some superimposition technique&#x201D;.</p><p name=2f0e id=2f0e class=graf--p>Author Dr. David Clarke interviewed Templeton many times. He doesn&#x2019;t believe Jim faked the photo. Clarke thinks his friends in the local photo lab may have mocked the photo up as a way of getting back at him for practical jokes he had played on them.</p><p name=eb08 id=eb08 class=graf--p>Even if the image was just a freak shot of his wife Annie accidentally walking into the top of the picture, could Jim have deliberately fanned the &#x2018;spaceman&#x2019; angle for a joke?</p><p name=80cf id=80cf class=graf--p>Other details of his story suggest he was at the very least prone to telling tales.</p><p name=339c id=339c class=graf--p>The two unnamed government officials who escorted Jim back to Burgh Marsh are often compared in UFO circles to the famous &#x2018;men in black&#x2019;. But aside from Jim&#x2019;s own claims, there is no evidence in declassified MOD files the encounter ever occurred.</p><figure name=458d id=458d class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*kb8EAmETwNRNC_yDF5NWhw.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*kb8EAmETwNRNC_yDF5NWhw.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*kb8EAmETwNRNC_yDF5NWhw.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>Nick Pope helped oversee the release of the British government&#x2019;s UFO files</figcaption></figure><p name=b209 id=b209 class=graf--p>In later years, Jim himself played up the sinister and mysterious aspects of the meeting but was somewhat more reticent in a 1964 newspaper article about the men.</p><blockquote name=a5d8 id=a5d8 class=graf--blockquote>It all looks like a leg-pull to me</blockquote><p name=4a7e id=4a7e class=graf--p>By then the police had become involved, and Jim seemed keen to dismiss the incident&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;&#x201C;It all looks like a leg-pull to me&#x201D;, he told the Cumberland News. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure the men were not security agents and I have no idea why they should want to pass themselves off as such&#x201D;.</p><p name=a71f id=a71f class=graf--p>Nick Pope, curator of the British Ministry of Defence&#x2019;s UFO files, thinks if the men existed at all, Jim&#x2019;s original assessment of them is most likely to be true.</p><p name=5dd0 id=5dd0 class=graf--p>During his time investigating sightings for the MOD, Pope collected dozens of accounts of fantasists and hoaxers posing as &#x2018;men in black&#x2019; in order to insert themselves into UFO stories.</p><p name=5d5b id=5d5b class=graf--p>Had Jim been hoaxed himself, or had he embroidered the encounter to make a better story?</p><p name=d27b id=d27b class=graf--p>As for the Woomera sighting of two mysteries beings that resembled the Solway spaceman, that claim also begins and ends with Jim Templeton himself.</p><figure name=c826 id=c826 class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*lE2Ppu0hhzDgY7rbKX6GrQ.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*lE2Ppu0hhzDgY7rbKX6GrQ.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*lE2Ppu0hhzDgY7rbKX6GrQ.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>There was no record of any spacemen at Woomera (credit: <span href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woomera_Immigration_Reception_and_Processing_Centre#/media/File:Woomera-irpc.jpg data-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woomera_Immigration_Reception_and_Processing_Centre#/media/File:Woomera-irpc.jpg class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel=nofollow>Schutz/wiki</span>)</figcaption></figure><p name=2c89 id=2c89 class=graf--p>Nowhere in the thousands of recently declassified MOD UFO files is there any reference to sightings of mysterious figures at Woomera.
