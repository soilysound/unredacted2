The U.S. military had discovered 2 mysterious satellites in Earth&#x2019;s orbit.</p><p name=00bb id=00bb class=graf--p>The Pentagon was reportedly furious about the story. They had not wanted the discovery to be made public. An explanation was quickly put out that the satellites were actually asteroids.</p><p name=52ec id=52ec class=graf--p>Whilst it is possible for Earth&#x2019;s orbit to capture an asteroid, it&#x2019;s extremely rare and only happens under certain unusual circumstances.

It would vanish for long periods before reappearing years later. What could it be?</p><p name=2766 id=2766 class=graf--p>The most intriguing idea came from an eminent Standford space scientist, Ronald Bracewell, and his theory for how an alien civilization might communicate with Earth.</p><p name=bf0b id=bf0b class=graf--p>Bracewell proposed such a civilization may send a probe out into the universe looking for planets that could evolve intelligent life.

The Dark Knight</h4><p name=709f id=709f class=graf--p>It is often suggested that the sightings of strange objects in Earth&#x2019;s orbit are space debris. This explanation is routinely used whenever news of such discoveries reach the press.</p><p name=653f id=653f class=graf--p>Back in 1960, when the U.S. Navy radar system Dark Fence spotted a huge object in polar orbit, it was quickly dismissed as space debris from the Discoverer program.</p><p name=a873 id=a873 class=graf--p>However, the object Dark Fence observed seemed to be too large and heavy to be space debris. It was estimated to be as much as 15 tons, far in excess of what any country in the world was capable of getting into space in 1960.</p><p name=ef43 id=ef43 class=graf--p>The Russians had the most powerful rockets at the time, but the heaviest payload they could manage was just over 2000 pounds.</p><figure name=667a id=667a class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*sWi8pwoVXDsSxcfNxlA2YQ.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*sWi8pwoVXDsSxcfNxlA2YQ.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*sWi8pwoVXDsSxcfNxlA2YQ.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>The object is much bigger than a piece of thermal blanket</figcaption></figure><p name=958f id=958f class=graf--p>The UFO was incredibly erratic, its orbit was hard to predict and studying it proved difficult.

Clearly, whatever Dark Fence had spotted was not space debris.</p><p name=76cb id=76cb class=graf--p>The most detailed ever pictures of a UFO in space were taken by the space shuttle Endeavor in 1998. These are the images most often cited as proof of the Dark Knight&#x2019;s existence.</p><p name=b90b id=b90b class=graf--p>NASA, however, dismissed the object as a thermal insulation blanket accidently dropped by an astronaut whilst constructing the Internation Space Station.</p><p name=a568 id=a568 class=graf--p>Again, like the 1960 explanation, this doesn&#x2019;t quite fit the facts. Although in most of the photos its hard to determine the scale of the object, one image does show it some distance below the Space Shuttle.</p><p name=b597 id=b597 class=graf--p>Even without taking perspective into account, the object appears to be as long as the Shuttle&#x2019;s cargo bay door, which was 60ft long.
