According to one member of the team, the skull shouldn&#x2019;t even exist.</p><p name=db10 id=db10 class=graf--p>For many, this was proof that the skull had been produced by an advanced civilization lost to history, a culture with technology beyond what we have even today.</p><p name=0701 id=0701 class=graf--p>Anna seemed vindicated.

Science steps in</h4><p name=54c9 id=54c9 class=graf--p>In the 1960s, Anna Mitchell-Hedges entrusted the skull into the care of crystal expert Frank Dorland. Whilst quartz crystal itself cannot be dated, Dorland felt a microscopic study of the skulls workmanship might reveal more about its origins.</p><p name=a193 id=a193 class=graf--p>To that end, in 1970 Hewlett-Packard was called into to examine the skull. The computer and electronics giant had some of the world&#x2019;s leading experts in quartz, as well as high-tech microscopes and x-ray equipment.</p><p name=b04b id=b04b class=graf--p>The firm&#x2019;s analysis of the skull only seemed to deepen its mystery.
