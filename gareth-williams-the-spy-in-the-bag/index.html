The body of a British spy found dead inside a sports bag, it&#x2019;s zipper padlocked shut from the outside.</p><p name=46ed id=46ed class=graf--p>Incredibly London&#x2019;s metropolitan police concluded the death was &#x201C;probably an accident&#x201D;. Their conclusion overturned an official inquest&#x2019;s findings that the death was &#x201C;unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated&#x201D;.</p><p name=6171 id=6171 class=graf--p>This uncertainty highlighted just why this was one of the most perplexing and complex unsolved murders in recent history. A case mired with contradictions and mysteries, obscured by secrets and lies and centering on a man who himself was an enigma.</p><p name=d810 id=d810 class=graf--p>That man was 31-year-old Gareth Williams, a brilliant mathematician and codebreaker at the UK&#x2019;s secret communications monitoring station GCHQ. William&#x2019;s work, thought to involve cyberterrorism, was classified top secret.</p><p name=981c id=981c class=graf--p>He was approaching the end of a one-year secondment to MI6, Britain&#x2019;s foreign security service, when on August 23rd his naked, heavily decomposed body was found curled up inside a padlocked red sports holdall in the bath of his top floor flat at an MI6 safe house.</p><p name=3f79 id=3f79 class=graf--p>Unusual features of the crime scene made the police&#x2019;s job virtually impossible from the start. Even though it was the middle of summer, the heating in the flat had been left on at the highest setting, hastening the decomposition of Williams body and making it impossible for the pathologist to ascertain the cause of death.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name=c1b9 id=c1b9 class="graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1020px; max-height: 1360px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*B7iFjQ8BwB8RaBVa45U6eA.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=1600 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*B7iFjQ8BwB8RaBVa45U6eA.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1200/1*B7iFjQ8BwB8RaBVa45U6eA.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>Gareth Williams was not reported missing for over a week</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name=85d7 id=85d7 class=graf--p>Odder still was the lack of DNA or fingerprints in the bathroom and on the bag.

Detectives were left with the overriding suspicion that Gareth Williams had been murdered.</p><p name=02ec id=02ec class=graf--p>A suspicion only deepened by the fact that the front door to Williams&#x2019; flat had been locked from the outside, indicating someone else had been at the premises before detectives had arrived. Whoever it was, had they cleaned the crime scene after them?</p><p name=ad6d id=ad6d class=graf--p>The obvious possibility was Williams had been killed by professionals in connection with his top secret work for MI6. But were they enemy agents or his own side? And why had the murder, if it was murder, been staged in such a bizarre fashion?</p><p name=340a id=340a class=graf--p>For detectives, they were facing a crime straight out of the pages of a Sherlock Holmes story. And in the absence of the great detective, they would have to try and find some answers from Gareth Williams&#x2019; employers at MI6.</p><p name=395a id=395a class=graf--p>Unfortunately, during the course of the subsequent investigation, the security services would consistently thwart attempts by the metropolitan police to properly investigate the crime. Crucial evidence was withheld and William&#x2019;s colleagues were not allowed to be interviewed.</p><figure name=4f2a id=4f2a class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*hVDuS26jZ_DXfJ74pdOHDQ.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*hVDuS26jZ_DXfJ74pdOHDQ.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*hVDuS26jZ_DXfJ74pdOHDQ.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>Gareth Williams pictured on CCTV just days before his death</figcaption></figure><p name=4efd id=4efd class=graf--p>Some even suspected MI6 of smearing the dead man in the media after lurid stories started to appear in the newspapers, from unknown sources, about Gareth Williams&#x2019; private life and his apparent predilection for bondage and transvestitism.</p><p name=2e7d id=2e7d class=graf--p>Whilst &#xA3;20,000 in women&#x2019;s clothing and a long red wig were found in his flat, the leaks to the press appeared to be a cynical attempt by someone to steer the story away from murder towards some kind of sex game gone wrong scenario.</p><p name=3d71 id=3d71 class=graf--p>MI6&apos;s role in the case became subject to even greater scrutiny when it was discovered that Williams had been missing for more than a week before anybody at his employers reported his absence.</p><p name=5958 id=5958 class=graf--p>The idea that someone involved in top secret work vital to the UK&#x2019;s national security would be allowed to go missing for so long struck many as particularly unbelievable. Could MI6 really be so grossly negligent or did they have something more sinister to hide?</p><p name=84b7 id=84b7 class=graf--p>In May 2012, an official coroner&#x2019;s inquest fiercely criticised both MI6 and their police liaison SO15 for obstructing the police inquiry and withholding evidence. Their evidence to the inquest, given in secret, was widely regarding as unconvincing.</p><p name=2936 id=2936 class=graf--p>But for the coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox, the central issue was still whether Gareth Williams could have locked himself in the bag from the inside. Employing experts in confined spaces, hundreds of attempts to replicate the feat were made without success.</p><figure name=2511 id=2511 class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*ETEctL8PXJrNNTejiTI9tA.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*ETEctL8PXJrNNTejiTI9tA.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*ETEctL8PXJrNNTejiTI9tA.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>Experts tried to reproduce the feat 400 times without success</figcaption></figure><p name=9db7 id=9db7 class=graf--p>On this and the balance of other evidence the inquest found William&#x2019;s death was probably due to &#x201C;criminal mediated&#x201D; actions from a third party. As a result, the metropolitan police reopened the case and spent more than a year re-examining the evidence.</p><p name=d9f8 id=d9f8 class=graf--p>In November 2013, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt told the press that his investigation had, controversially, concluded that Williams&#x2019; death was &#x201C;most probably&#x201D; an accident, although he also acknowledged the numerous gaps in their knowledge about the case.</p><p name=a3f3 id=a3f3 class=graf--p>This belated reversal of the inquest&#x2019;s findings did little to reassure the public or Williams&#x2019; family that foul play had not played a part in his death.

When the police arrived at the flat, they were surprised to discover the heating was in at the maximum setting, despite the fact Williams had died during the middle of a warm summer.</p><p name=c4bb id=c4bb class=graf--p>The excessive heat hastened the decomposition of the body, meaning pathologists were unable to determine the cause of death. Some of the detectives at the scene felt this was another attempt by an unknown third party to destroy evidence, a suspicion also echoed by the coroner.</p><p name=cee8 id=cee8 class=graf--p>One further troubling piece of evidence seemed to confirm the crime scene had been cleaned up. Williams&#x2019; phone was laying on a table when his body was discovered, but police found it had been restored to its factory settings just hours before his death.</p><p name=d43d id=d43d class=graf--p>At the inquest, coroner Fiona Wilcox was particular concerned by this, suggesting that the phone may have been used to arrange the meeting with Williams&#x2019; killers.</p><h4 name=1922 id=1922 class=graf--h4>2. Harry Houdini</h4><p name=e322 id=e322 class=graf--p>So much of this most baffling of cases revolves around the issue of whether Gareth Williams could really have locked himself in the sports bag from the inside.</p><p name=5300 id=5300 class=graf--p>To this end, numerous reconstructions were attempted, supervised by two experts in confined spaces, William Mackay and Peter Faulding. Together they made over 400 attempts to try and lock themselves into the same type of red North Face duffel bag in which Gareth Williams&#x2019; body was found.</p><p name=b0ea id=b0ea class=graf--p>Neither were able to replicate the feat. &#x201C;We got close, but close is still far away. That was based upon hundreds and hundreds of attempts, maybe if we had tried it 2,000 times we would have done it, I don&#x2019;t know, but there were two of us&#x201D;, Mackay said.</p><p name=1761 id=1761 class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">&#x201C;I cannot say it is impossible but I think even Houdini would struggle with this one&#x201D;, Faulding told the inquest. &#x201C;I believe he was placed in the bag by a third person&#x201D;.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name=d0e3 id=d0e3 class="graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1020px; max-height: 1360px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*yn2Twiahmzo4uAlDTrSkvA.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=1600 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*yn2Twiahmzo4uAlDTrSkvA.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1200/1*yn2Twiahmzo4uAlDTrSkvA.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>The complexities of locking oneself inside of a bag were widely likened to the feats of legendary escapologist Harry Houdini</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name=c259 id=c259 class=graf--p>Shortly after the inquest, army sergeant Jim Fetherstonhaugh came forward to claim he had have achieved what had defied the experts. Using a trick employed by airport thieves to steal from locked bags, Fetherstonhaugh was able to successfully demonstrate the technique with his daughter standing in for Williams.</p><p name=251a id=251a class=graf--p>However, Mackay dismissed the new evidence. &#x201C;One person did come forward, but the eyelets weren&#x2019;t put together, in the same way, we dispelled that method as it wasn&#x2019;t the way that the bag was closed&#x201D;.</p><p name=42a4 id=42a4 class=graf--p>Perhaps a more prosaic reason to doubt the accident theory is the lack of any signs of a struggle.

Smear campaign</h4><p name=6f43 id=6f43 class=graf--p>Almost as soon as the police investigation into Gareth Williams&#x2019; death started, so did the leaks.

Sex games</h4><p name=a4b5 id=a4b5 class=graf--p>Former intelligence advisor Crispin Black, who attended the inquest, suggested the &#x2018;sex game gone wrong&#x2019; scenario is a favourite method of concealing murder for intelligence agencies.</p><p name=9562 id=9562 class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">&#x201C;Disposing of an enemy and making it look like a perverted fantasy gone wrong is in the training manuals of every spy agency from MI6 to Mossad&#x201D;, he wrote in Scotlands Daily Record.</p><blockquote name=5c96 id=5c96 class=graf--blockquote>Disposing of an enemy and making it look like a perverted fantasy gone wrong is in the training manuals of every spy agency from MI6 to Mossad</blockquote><p name=160f id=160f class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">&#x201C;[He] was found dead in a locked bag, in a flat full of women&#x2019;s clothing and wigs and with his internet browsing history conveniently featuring bondage sites&#x201D;, Black said.</p><p name=bd8b id=bd8b class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">&#x201C;The sex game cover is a very useful mechanism in a murder.

But it&#x2019;s a misconception that forensic evidence is always found at murder scenes.</p><p name=4338 id=4338 class=graf--p>Prosecutors call this the &#x2018;CSI effect&#x2019;. In many modern trials, jurors have become so accustomed to the exaggerated portrayal of forensic science on television shows and films that they expect all cases to revolve around such evidence.</p><figure name=1d50 id=1d50 class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*jdLTTVOJKwSwaxjnvFzObg.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*jdLTTVOJKwSwaxjnvFzObg.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*jdLTTVOJKwSwaxjnvFzObg.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>Juries now expect DNA evidence in all murder cases, but it&#x2019;s not unusual for none to be found.</figcaption></figure><p name=7808 id=7808 class=graf--p>Many lawyers in murder cases will call a forensic expert to testify even if there is no forensic evidence in the case, simply because that&#x2019;s the standard of evidence jurors demand.</p><p name=d5ed id=d5ed class=graf--p>In actual fact, only about 13% of murder cases involve any forensic evidence at all.

Predilections</h4><p name=6145 id=6145 class=graf--p>Chief Inspector Jackie Sebire, the head of the murder inquiry, and the coroner both dismissed any sexual motive in Gareth Williams death. But some commentators have suggested this may have been a hasty conclusion.</p><p name=e80d id=e80d class=graf--p>The coroner&#x2019;s explanation that the &#xA3;20,000 in women&#x2019;s clothing and the red ladies wig found in Williams&#x2019; flat were just &#x2018;gifts for friends&#x2019; struck many as particularly absurd and unconvincing.</p><p name=8003 id=8003 class=graf--p>And although Police experts disputed that this was how it was done in William&#x2019;s case, a technique was eventually discovered that would allow someone to lock themselves into a bag from the inside.</p><p name=1322 id=1322 class=graf--p><figure><div class=figure__iframe-con><iframe frameborder=0 allowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XIjzZlMQaeg?list=PLg_WffBTk2IgsrcSm_0Qh0KrSzQk-Jexi"></iframe></div></figure></p><p name=6166 id=6166 class=graf--p>Could the bizarre death have been a sex game that went tragically wrong?
