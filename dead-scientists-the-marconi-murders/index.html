Untypical suicide methods</h4><p name=f853 id=f853 class=graf--p>Professor Colin Pritchard, a noted expert in mental illness and suicides, thinks at least some of the deaths were statistically uncommon.</p><p name=af78 id=af78 class=graf--p>Whilst its true suicide is one of the most prevalent causes of early death in men, especially young men, Pritchard believes factors in some of the cases make the suicide verdicts unlikely.</p><p name=832b id=832b class=graf--p>Pritchard cites the cases of at least 4 of the men that share unusual elements. All 4 men had complained to friends and family that they had been tasked &#x2018;strange&#x2019;, &#x2018;impossible&#x2019; and &#x2018;unscientific&#x2019; tasks by their employers.</p><p name=4ec0 id=4ec0 class=graf--p>All 4 men committed suicide in incredibly violent and bizarre ways. Pritchard has studied numerous suicide cases and thinks such extreme suicide methods are normally only associated with people suffering severe mental breakdowns, to the extent they would be unable to even hold down jobs.</p><p name=7a96 id=7a96 class=graf--p>Yet the men were all employed up until the day of their deaths and none had shown any sign of mental illness or other disturbance.</p><p name=c61e id=c61e class=graf--p>All of the men had also recently found new jobs and were preparing to leave within days of their deaths. Likewise, all 4 men had recently arranged appointments with their MPs.</p><p name=769d id=769d class=graf--p>What were the strange &#x2018;unscientific&#x2019; projects that the men were complaining of, and why had they all booked appointments with their MPs? Had they stumbled on something in their jobs that had worried them&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;something that led to them been silenced?</p><h4 name=1bf7 id=1bf7 class=graf--h4>4. Sexual misadventure as method of murder</h4><p name=52f9 id=52f9 class=graf--p>Several of the deaths were put down to sex games gone wrong. But intelligence expert Conrad Black says death by sexual misadventure is a common method of disguising murder in the world of espionage.</p><p name=aec3 id=aec3 class=graf--p>Black told the Daily Record&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;&#x201C;Disposing of an enemy and making it look like a perverted fantasy gone wrong is in the training manuals of every spy agency from MI6 to Mossad.</p><p name=b7e9 id=b7e9 class=graf--p>The sex game cover is a very useful mechanism in a murder. Not only does it provide a disguise for the actual means and method of death, it trashes the reputation of the victim and blunts the energy of any subsequent investigation.&#x201D;</p><h4 name=ec32 id=ec32 class=graf--h4>5. Foreign Sabotage</h4><p name=88a8 id=88a8 class=graf--p>The Marconi deaths weren&#x2019;t the only unexplained, violent or unusual deaths amongst defence workers in Europe in the 1980s.</p><p name=5c14 id=5c14 class=graf--p>In West Germany in 1986 there were several incidents involving individuals associated with America&#x2019;s SDI&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;the Strategic Defence Initiative dubbed &#x2018;Star Wars&#x2019; by the press.</p><p name=4994 id=4994 class=graf--p>The Strategic Defence Initiative was an ambitious programme to create a space based anti-nuclear weapon shield which would have rendered Soviet nuclear capability useless.</p><figure name=14b6 id=14b6 class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*ilS8xxDTtxayBhsPHBZc9Q.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*ilS8xxDTtxayBhsPHBZc9Q.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*ilS8xxDTtxayBhsPHBZc9Q.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>Karl-Heinz Beckurts was killed by a car bomb in 1986</figcaption></figure><p name=e87f id=e87f class=graf--p>In July, Karl-Heinz Beckurts, a director at Siemens and an SDI contractor was killed by a car bomb in Munich.</p><p name=b4cf id=b4cf class=graf--p>Later in &#x2018;86, Gerrold von Bruanmuhl, a senior advisor in SDI negotiations was killed. There were other attacks on firms related to SDI and German prosecutors believed they were been targeted.</p><p name=8ae8 id=8ae8 class=graf--p>Similar deaths and disappearances amongst defence figures in Sweden and Italy occurred at the same time, giving rise to the suspicion that there was an Eastern Bloc plot to attack Western defence capability and the SDI.</p><p name=516f id=516f class=graf--p>Attempting to undermine an enemy&#x2019;s defence capabilities by murdering their scientists is not uncommon. The US, UK and Israel have all been known to strategically stage accidents to remove high-ranking enemy scientists for political ends.</p><p name=377b id=377b class=graf--p>In recent years at least 4 top Iranian nuclear scientist have been killed by Israel&#x2019;s Mossad in an attempt to derail Iran&#x2019;s nuclear programme.</p><p name=21d1 id=21d1 class=graf--p>Killing targets in a foreign country is also not uncommon.

Stress</h4><p name=821d id=821d class=graf--p>The British government, Marconi and many in the press blamed stress in the high-pressure defence industry for the cluster of suicides.</p><p name=c06b id=c06b class=graf--p>Stress has often been cited as a problem in the secret defence industry and may have been a contributing factor to the cluster of suicides.</p><p name=42a3 id=42a3 class=graf--p>Suicide is the most common form of death in men aged 20&#x2013;49&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;the age bracket into which almost all the Marconi scientists fell into.</p><p name=68fa id=68fa class=graf--p>It would therefore not be unexpected to find a fair number of suicides in a male dominated occupation, especially one that operates under such tight secrecy.</p><p name=89c1 id=89c1 class=graf--p>Some of the widows commented on how their husbands were unable to talk about their secret work. If they were having trouble with the jobs, the fact they may have been unable to discuss the situation with their loved ones may have been another contributory factor.</p></div></div><ul
