Waking the Dead</h4><p name=46e0 id=46e0 class=graf--p>At the subsequent trial, Ronald Defeo Jr proved to be a terrible witness. His story constantly changed and his erratic and strange behavior alienated him to everyone. He even threatened to kill the judge and his own lawyer.</p><p name=89e8 id=89e8 class=graf--p>On November 21, 1975, he was found guilty on 6 counts of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to 6 concurrent 25-year sentences, although he is unlikely to ever be released. But despite the conviction, it was clear there was a serious problem with the official story.</p><p name=d87b id=d87b class=graf--p>The court had determined that Defeo had acted alone, killing all 6 members of his family with a&#xA0;.35 gauge Marlin rifle. Defeo had supposedly shot each victim as they slept, and both prosecution and defence agreed he had not used a silencer.</p><figure name=1715 id=1715 class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*UA3e0IcT8L8op9vay2C_RA.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*UA3e0IcT8L8op9vay2C_RA.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*UA3e0IcT8L8op9vay2C_RA.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>Defeo&#x2019;s mother and father were both shot twice and were found laying face down in their beds</figcaption></figure><p name=ccc9 id=ccc9 class=graf--p>How had Defeo committed the shooting alone without any of his family waking up?

Who had helped him commit this horrifying crime?</p><h4 name=15fc id=15fc class=graf--h4>2. Dawn</h4><p name=945c id=945c class=graf--p>Several investigators and authors have suggested Butch Defeo&#x2019;s oldest sister Dawn played some part in the shootings.</p><p name=73a7 id=73a7 class=graf--p>The first 5 victims were on the 2nd floor of the Defeo house. Ronald Snr and mother Louise Defeo were both shot twice in the master bedroom. Moving across to the other side of the house, the gunman then shot the 2 boys, Marc and John.</p><p name=61cf id=61cf class=graf--p>Completing the 2nd floor shootings, 13 year old Alison DeFeo was shot once in the head. That&#x2019;s a total of 7 shots, at 140 decibels each, before the gunman even started to ascend the stairs to Dawn Defeo&#x2019;s 3rd floor bedroom.</p><p name=7a55 id=7a55 class=graf--p>It is, therefore, unthinkable that Dawn, entirely unsedated or drugged, would not already have been alerted to a gunman before they had even arrived on the 3rd floor. Yet as we have seen, she appeared to be peacefully asleep, face down in her bed, having made no attempt to escape, defend herself or hide.</p><figure name=f58e id=f58e class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*70bBtKA3e4djjlTNR8gHgg.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*70bBtKA3e4djjlTNR8gHgg.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*70bBtKA3e4djjlTNR8gHgg.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>Dawn, like the other victims, was found face down in her bed</figcaption></figure><p name=e96d id=e96d class=graf--p>Had Dawn, as some suspected, actually participated in the shooting herself, only to then be shot by her brother and placed in her bed?</p><p name=82eb id=82eb class=graf--p>Although Butch DeFeo is notorious for the sheer number of contradictory stories he has told about the murders over the years, one of his more consistent accounts is, indeed, that Dawn took part in the killings.</p><p name=c331 id=c331 class=graf--p>In most versions of his story, he has claimed responsibility for the murder of his mother and father and showed little remorse for them. But he has often blamed Dawn for killing the families children&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Marc, John and Allison. After discovering what she had done, Defeo says he then killed Dawn after a struggle with the rifle.</p><p name=af80 id=af80 class=graf--p>Some evidence does exist to tentatively support this scenario. Dawn seems to have been killed somewhere other than her bed and placed there after he death.</p><p name=9eb3 id=9eb3 class=graf--p>Crime scene investigators discovered that Dawn had suffered a huge head wound, and that brain matter and blood was on her pillow, bedclothes and nightgown. Yet her white headboard, just inches from her head, was pristine. The lack of blood splatter was strongly indicitave that she had been shot somewhere else.</p><p name=5332 id=5332 class=graf--p>Blood splatter was also found on a dresser and floorboards in the house, again demonstrating the possibility at least some of the shootings had occured away from the beds.</p><p name=9725 id=9725 class=graf--p>Some investigators have speculated that unburnt gunshot residue found on Dawn&#x2019;s body indicate she may have handled a firearm or ammunation, although the proscution expert at the trial, Alfred Della Penna, thought this could have occured as a result of the muzzle flash when Dawn was shot.</p><p name=26c9 id=26c9 class=graf--p>Rick Moran, amongst the first group of reports at the scene the night the bodies were discovered, has studied the Defeo murders for more than 30 years. He is sure that Dawn was involved in some way.</p><p name=c9f3 id=c9f3 class=graf--p>Moran cites one of Butch Defeo&#x2019;s strangest claims amongst his many conflicting statements as evidence. Defeo has said several times that on the night of the shootings he was watching TV in a drug induced haze when a strange black hooded figure came to him and handed him a rifle, and urged him to commit the murders.</p><p name=4315 id=4315 class=graf--p>Moran thinks this figure could have been Dawn. According to the reporter, Dawn was often spotted by neighbours wearing a black snorkel style coat, which may have led a heavily stoned Butch to mistake her for the sinister figure.</p><p name=c894 id=c894 class=graf--p>Although clearly highly anecdotal, Moran says one of his contacts at the Drug Enforcement Agency backs up the story. He had told Moran that someone from the DEA actually had the house under surveillance the night of the murders, due to a suspicion that Butch had been smuggling drugs in his speedboat.</p><figure name=318a id=318a class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*8BBcdLCBN83SV9yVF28PxQ.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*8BBcdLCBN83SV9yVF28PxQ.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*8BBcdLCBN83SV9yVF28PxQ.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>Blood splatter found on walls and floors indicated some victims were shot away from their beds</figcaption></figure><p name=007b id=007b class=graf--p>This DEA agent had supposedly observed Dawn in her black coat leaving the house with a rifle, getting into a car and driving off in the direction the firearm was subsequently found by the police.</p><p name=c79b id=c79b class=graf--p>If Dawn and Butch plotted the murders together, could Butch&#x2019;s incapacity due to heavy drug use have spurred Dawn to commit them herself? And once Butch had come down, had he shot Dawn after the horror of what she had done dawned on him?</p><p name=26bb id=26bb class=graf--p>On the face of it this scenario seems far-fetched. But it does help explain many of the puzzling and intractable issues with the crime scene. And evidence from the trial indicates Dawn&#x2019;s mindset may have been disturbed enough to make her taking such extreme actions seem at least plausible.</p><p name=fd44 id=fd44 class=graf--p>Dawn&#x2019;s boyfriend William Davidge stated to the court that Dawn was a habitual user of LSD and mescaline and had recently started to become extremely hostile towards her parents because they had refused to allow her to live with him.</p><p name=75df id=75df class=graf--p>The Defeo family were by all accounts dysfunction and troubled, and Ronald Defeo Snr was reported to be particularly violent, controlling and abusive to both his wife and children, all commonly cited factors in parenticide.</p><p name=e57f id=e57f class=graf--p>Butch Defeo has given several different versions of the murders in which people other than Dawn Defeo were part of the conspiracy, but with little or no evidence to support them, Dawn remains the most likely canidate for an extra shooter.</p><h3 name=76ff id=76ff class=graf--h3>Evidence Against</h3><h4 name=6ed1 id=6ed1 class=graf--h4>1. The Bad Seed</h4><p name=0741 id=0741 class=graf--p>In the hours following the shooting, when police interviewed local Amityville residents, many told the detectives they felt Butch Defeo was responsible.</p><p name=1ab5 id=1ab5 class=graf--p>Considering the reputation Defeo had developed in the sleepy community, it was not so surprising that residents immediately felt he had committed the atrocity. Over the years, he was continually in trouble for his thuggish and erratic behaviour, theft and drug abuse.</p><p name=1883 id=1883 class=graf--p>During the run up to the murders, Defeo&#x2019;s drug taking had become particularly acute. By his own admission, he was consuming huge amounts of heroin and marijuana and drinking a bottle of scotch every day, despite already been on probation for drug crimes at the time.</p><p name=61a3 id=61a3 class=graf--p>His violence was also spiraling out of control. At the trial, much testimony was offered for Defeo&#x2019;s temper and obsession with guns. One witness recalled how Defeo had held a shotgun up at the head of a young man during a hunting party, and watched stony-faced as the man turned white with fear.</p><figure name=34a8 id=34a8 class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*j69_jITZo4xW0bOadzsL-w.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*j69_jITZo4xW0bOadzsL-w.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*j69_jITZo4xW0bOadzsL-w.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>Ronald&apos;s Jr and Sr had an abusive and violent relationship</figcaption></figure><p name=8cc8 id=8cc8 class=graf--p>On another occasion, Defeo has held a 12 gauge shotgun up against his father&#x2019;s head during an argument and even pulled the trigger. The shotgun failed to fire and Defeo Snr reportedly found religion soon afterwards.</p><p name=48cc id=48cc class=graf--p>Psychologists subsequently diagnosed Butch as having anti-social personality disorder, displaying little or no empathy for other people. Some speculated that Defeo&#x2019;s many different accounts of the murders were attempts to shift blame for the deaths of his siblings to anyone but himself.</p><p name=3663 id=3663 class=graf--p>Whilst Defoe showed no feelings for his mother and detested his father, he would always become agited and upset when talking about the deaths of his brothers and little sister. If he could successfully convince others and perhaps even himself that someone else had killed the children, it may have helped to assuage his own guilt about the murders.</p><h4 name=8491 id=8491 class=graf--h4>2. Ballistics</h4><p name=60f6 id=60f6 class=graf--p>One of the major problems with the multiple gunmen scenario is the testimony of the prosecution&#x2019;s ballistics experts who stated all of the wounds to the 6 victims were made with the same firearm.</p><p name=ab43 id=ab43 class=graf--p>A study of the wounds to the Defoe family, and the expended cartridges found at the crime scene indicated 8 shots had been fired. All 8 shell casing were found and forensically linked to the&#xA0;.35 caliber Marlin rifle found by police thrown in the dock directly behind the house.</p><figure name=3d47 id=3d47 class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*29yAeI5IgA_KFKAza7qsxg.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*29yAeI5IgA_KFKAza7qsxg.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*29yAeI5IgA_KFKAza7qsxg.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>Ammunition for the murder weapon was found in Butch&#x2019;s room</figcaption></figure><p name=53b1 id=53b1 class=graf--p>Although Herman Race, an experienced criminologist hired by the defence, disputed this ballistic evidence, it seemed quite conclusive. But it did little to reconcile the enduring and seemingly intractable contradictions in the case.</p><p name=44be id=44be class=graf--p>To this day, no truly satisfactory account of what happened has ever been offered. Butch Defeo is no help, seemingly lost in his own miasma of lies and delusions, and everyone else who was there is dead.</p><p name=94aa id=94aa class=graf--p>All we know for sure is that 6 lives were destoyed, 7 if you count Butch Defeo, who will surely die in prison.
