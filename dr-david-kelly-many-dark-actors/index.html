The Doctors dissent</h4><p name=af5d id=af5d class=graf--p>The medical evidence surrounding Kelly&#x2019;s death proved to be highly controversial. The official verdict was that he had died due to a self-inflicted injury to the ulnar artery and an overdose of his wife&#x2019;s co-proxamol tablets.</p><p name=752b id=752b class=graf--p>Many medical professionals disagreed. In a series of letters to the national press, a number of concerned doctors disputed the official verdict. They felt the injuries to Kelly could not cause his death.</p><blockquote name=379f id=379f class=graf--blockquote>I have never seen one death of somebody from cutting an ulnar artery.</blockquote><p name=e6a4 id=e6a4 class=graf--p>They pointed out people rarely die by wrist cutting. The arteries immediately begin to close up and constrict the blood loss. Dr Bill McQuillan, who had dealt with hundreds of wrist accidents said&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;&#x201C;I have never seen one death of somebody from cutting an ulnar artery.&#x201D;</p><p name=e1cb id=e1cb class=graf--p>The choice of the ulnar artery was particularly odd. The ulnar artery is deeper in the wrist and covered by nerves and tendons, which would require considerable force to cut. Why would Kelly choose that rather than the easy to access radial artery?</p><p name=12b3 id=12b3 class=graf--p>Nor could the painkillers have caused his death. The levels of the drug found in his stomach and bloodstream were much too low to have killed Kelly. 3 empty blister packs were found on Kelly&#x2019;s body, but this was no proof of ingestion.</p><figure name=d933 id=d933 class=graf--figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*Tjb58n9uJWa1iNaygyVlcw.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=800 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*Tjb58n9uJWa1iNaygyVlcw.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*Tjb58n9uJWa1iNaygyVlcw.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>Kelly supposedly had trouble swallowing pills</figcaption></figure><p name=3a5e id=3a5e class=graf--p>The paramedics agreed with the doctors. David Bartlett and Vanessa Hunt, the first medical professionals to tend to Kelly were so baffled as to the lack of blood at the scene they went to the press.</p><p name=cd89 id=cd89 class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen more blood at a nosebleed than I saw there&#x201D;, Bartlett said in an interview. The arterial spray should have covered Kelly and the whole area with blood but very little was found.</p><p name=d6ec id=d6ec class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">&#x201C;There just wasn&#x2019;t a lot of blood&#xA0;&#x2026; When somebody cuts an artery, whether accidentally or intentionally, the blood pumps everywhere&#x201D;, Hunt said.</p><p name=19f3 id=19f3 class=graf--p>Dr Bill McQuillan concurred. If Kelly has slit his ulnar artery &#x201C;&#x2026;his clothes, face and any surrounding structures would show evidence of that with the blood scattered as from a watering can&#x201D;.</p><p name=491b id=491b class=graf--p>Some blood was found at the scene, but it takes around 3&#x2013;4 pints of blood loss for an adult male to die&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;a huge amount that should have been apparent to all present.</p><h4 name=d38b id=d38b class=graf--h4>4. Gaps in the evidence</h4><p name=3ddd id=3ddd class=graf--p>According to police reports, various items were found at the scene&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;a small water bottle, a gardening knife, a painkiller blister pack, his glasses and his watch.</p><p name=eedc id=eedc class=graf--p>No fingerprints were found on any of the objects. Whilst it is common to find no identifiable fingerprints on such evidence, to find no prints at all is unusual. No mention of this was made at Hutton.</p><p name=3b93 id=3b93 class=graf--p>The water bottle found near Kelly&#x2019;s body was still half full. It&#x2019;s difficult to see how Kelly could have swallowed 29 co-proxamol tablets, as alleged, with such little water.</p><p name=4b28 id=4b28 class=graf--p>Worse still, Hutton failed to mention reports that Kelly suffered from &#x2018;unexplained dysphagia&#x2019; a syndrome that makes it difficult for the subject to swallow pills.</p><p name=7ce7 id=7ce7 class=graf--p>Hutton failed to cover another medical issue. Kelly had fractured his left elbow earlier that year and according to friends was &#x201C;unable to cut a steak&#x201D; with his right hand. Why then, would Kelly choose to cut his wrists with his right hand?</p><p name=e9ee id=e9ee class=graf--p>Kelly, an expert in the &#x2018;science of death&#x2019; had chosen an unlikely suicide method. Kelly would have been well aware that wrist slitting was unlikely to kill him; it is normally associated with young people and a &#x2018;cry for help&#x2019;.</p><p name=f172 id=f172 class=graf--p>Hutton also glossed over some disturbing details from the autopsy.</p><p name=f5aa id=f5aa class=graf--p>Various scuffs, abrasions and cuts were found, but they were blithely dismissed as been caused by Kelly &#x2018;stumbling&#x2019;. Could they have been evidence of a struggle with a third party?</p><p name=b19b id=b19b class=graf--p>Acetone was found in Kelly&#x2019;s blood and urine, which may have indicated he died much later than thought&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;later than 1am. If so, the obvious question is why Kelly would disappear then wait some 8 hours or more to commit suicide?</p><p name=010f id=010f class=graf--p>These problems with the suicide scenario, along with the improbability of it proving fatal led to a campaign by a group of Doctors to have an official inquest opened into Kelly&#x2019;s death.</p><h4 name=dc39 id=dc39 class=graf--h4>5. Whitewash</h4><p name=fe5d id=fe5d class=graf--p>The Hutton inquiry was set up the day after Kelly&#x2019;s death and it immediately shut down and superseded the corners inquest.</p><p name=d989 id=d989 class=graf--p>Inquests are routinely opened in the case of violent, sudden or suspicious deaths. They are legal bodies that have the power of subpeona and evidence is given under oath.</p><p name=5ad0 id=5ad0 class=graf--p>In contrast, the Hutton inquiry had no legal authority, failed to call many key witnesses and no evidence was given under oath. Amazingly, even the head of the police investigation into Kelly&#x2019;s death was not called to testify.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name=79a3 id=79a3 class="graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1020px; max-height: 1360px;"><div class=aspect-ratio-fill style="padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;"></div><img class=lazy-load data-image-id=1*ntm2YqkCyWYyDALKb5gQWQ.jpeg data-width=1200 data-height=1600 data-action=zoom data-action-value=1*ntm2YqkCyWYyDALKb5gQWQ.jpeg src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1200/1*ntm2YqkCyWYyDALKb5gQWQ.jpeg srcset="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></div><figcaption class=imageCaption>David Kelly in happier times</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name=2139 id=2139 class=graf--p>This caused disquiet and concern even amongst those who believed Kelly killed himself.
